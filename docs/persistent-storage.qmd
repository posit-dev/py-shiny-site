## Intro

## When do you actually need persistent storage
* You want your application to collect and save information from your users. Example, forms.
* You need to save a result that your users generate? (ex. save a copy of report generated)

Note: What are we not talking about here: Auth. Link to any auth docs we have.

CALLOUT: Connect does both Auth and supports secrets for storage. Link to those docs.

## Saving to the filesystem?
Cover best practices with saving to shared servers/spaces?
Ex. Saving to a shared drive from a local server?

### Example with pins and polars? (use a form, save the result)

### Example with DuckDB (use a form, save the result)

## Connecting to databases

### Example connecting with Ibis and saving to db with a form

### SQL injection prevention

### Connection pooling & transaction locking?

### Note on credentials? (don't use your admin creds in your app, have user creds for db, scope them narrowly, etc.)
