Testing is important to ensure your apps continue working as intended.
There are two main approaches to testing Shiny apps: unit testing and end-to-end testing.
Relatively speaking, unit tests much more limited compared to end-to-end, but they're also simpler to write and maintain since they don't depend on running the app in a browser.
Unit tests also tend to force you to separate the app's "business" logic from the reactive logic (which can be a good thing) since your app won't have access to things like `input` or `output` in a unit test.

In this article, we'll provide a short guide on unit testing with **pytest**. See the next article for end-to-end testing.

### Make your app testable

Consider the following Shiny app that filters a dataset based on a user's selection of species.

```{.python filename="app.py"}
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
from shiny.express import input, render, ui

penguins = load_penguins()

ui.input_select(
  "species", "Enter a species",
  list(penguins.species.unique())
)

@render.data_frame
def display_dat():
    idx = penguins.species.isin(input.species())
    return penguins[idx]
```

None of the logic can be tested directly through a unit test.[^end-to-end]
We can, however, put the logic for `display_dat` inside separate function, which can be then be tested independently of the Shiny app:

[^end-to-end]: You could test this with an end-to-end test, but that's for the next article.

```python
@render.data_frame
def display_dat():
    return filter_penguins(input.species())

def filter_penguins(species):
    return penguins[penguins.species.isin(species)]
```

Now that we have a function that doesn't rely on a reactive `input` value, we can write a unit test for it.
There are many unit testing frameworks available for Python, but we'll use **pytest** in this article since it's by far the most common.


### pytest

[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/contents.html) is a popular, open-source testing framework for Python.
To get started, you'll first want to install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

`pytest` expects tests to be in files with names that start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`.
It also expects test functions to start with `test_`.
Here's an example of a test file for the `filter_penguins` function:

```{.python filename="test_filter_penguins.py"}
from app import filter_penguins

def test_filter_penguins():
    assert filter_penguins(["Adelie"]).shape[0] == 152
    assert filter_penguins(["Gentoo"]).shape[0] == 124
    assert filter_penguins(["Chinstrap"]).shape[0] == 68
    assert filter_penguins(["Adelie", "Gentoo"]).shape[0] == 276
    assert filter_penguins(["Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap"]).shape[0] == 344
```

Assuming both the `app.py` and `test_filter_penguins.py` files are in the same directory, you can now run the test by typing `pytest` in your terminal.
`pytest` will automatically locate the test file and run it with the results shown below.

```bash
platform darwin -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-7.4.4, pluggy-1.4.0
configfile: pytest.ini
plugins: asyncio-0.21.0, timeout-2.1.0, Faker-20.1.0, cov-4.1.0, playwright-0.4.4, rerunfailures-11.1.2, xdist-3.3.1, base-url-2.1.0, hydra-core-1.3.2, anyio-3.7.0, syrupy-4.0.5, shiny-1.0.0
asyncio: mode=strict
12 workers [1 item]
.          [100%]
(3 durations < 5s hidden.  Use -vv to show these durations.)
```

If a test fails, `pytest` will show you which test failed and why:

```bash
======================================================= test session starts =======================================================
platform darwin -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-7.4.4, pluggy-1.4.0

asyncio: mode=strict
12 workers [1 item]
F       [100%]
======= FAILURES =======
________ test_double_number ________

    def test_filter_penguins():
>       assert filter_penguins(["Adelie"]).shape[0] == 150
E       AssertionError: assert 152 == 150
E        +  where 152 = filter_penguins(["Adelie"]).shape[0]

```

Unit testing is a great way to ensure that your "business" logic is working as expected.
However, to fully ensure your app is working as intended, you'll also want to write end-to-end tests.
In the next article, we'll show you how to write end-to-end tests for your Shiny app via **Playwright**.
