The term, _user interface_ (UI), refers to the part of an application that is visible to the user.
The UI is typically composed of a collection of components (e.g. buttons, sliders, plots, etc) that allow the user to interact with the application.
Shiny provides roughly three types of UI components:

1. **Inputs**: Components that gather user input (e.g. sliders, text boxes, etc).
2. **Outputs**: Components that display the results (e.g. plots, tables, etc).
3. **Layouts**: Components that arrange other components (e.g. columns, tabs, etc). Page layouts are a special type of layout that are used to start a new UI.
