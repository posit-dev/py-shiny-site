Another type of UI component is one used to display messages to the user (e.g. notifications, modals, tooltips, etc).
Display messages like notifications and modals require server-side code to manage their state, so they are typically created in the server and then shown/hidden using the `ui.*_show()` and `ui.*_hide()` functions. Tooltips and popovers, on the other hand, can be created directly in the UI definition (i.e., statically rendered, without any server-side code).
