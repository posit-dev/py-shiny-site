In the previous lesson,
we saw how to create and run a basic shiny for python application.

Now let's see how we can layout different user interfaces.

If you are trying to whip up a quick application that needs input controls
and reactive outputs, shiny express tries to make this as simple as possible
by inferring the user interface and page layout for you.
However,
you have the option (and ability) to override these default layouts.

We will assume that you have the pre-existing knowledge on how to
load a dataframe from a csv file, filter the data, calculate summaries from the data,
and plot results.
Here we will set the foundation on how to set up the UI that our code will
insert into to be displayed in a web application or dashboard.

:::{.callout-tip}
When building your Shiny applications,
a general good practice is break up the application into two (2) separate steps

1. Write the code for whatever interactive components you want
    and use variables as place holders for the code.
    It isn't interactive without code modifications yet,
    but it'll help to make sure you have all the code working as you add interactive
    components to it.
2. Outline the general user interface either literally on paper and/or put in
    placeholder  UI elements to get a sense of the look and feel of your application.

You can do these steps in whatever asynchronously and in whatever order you'd like.
By keeping these steps separate,
especially as you are learning the framework,
you'll reduce the risks of creating errors and bugs that may be hard to point down.

## Layout User Interfaces

We can lay out the input and output components on our web application using different
[shiny layouts](/layouts/).
We can have different navigation bars, sidebars, tabs, panels, and cards to control where each
component is displayed on the page.

:::{.callout-note}
We will talk about the different input and output components separately in
later lessons of this tutorial.

All the individual input components begin with a `input_*()` function.
You can find a list of all the inputs in the
[input components gallery](/components/#inputs).

Outputs are created by decorating a function with the `@render.*()` decorator.
You can find a list of all the outputs in the
[outputs components gallery](/components/#outputs).
:::


Layouts in Shiny Express begin with the `with ui.*():` python context manager.
Here is an example of an Shiny Express application with a sidebar on the left.
One use case for this kind of layout is to provide the user the ability to interact
with components on the page
but also hide away the components to declutter
the application when they are not needed.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 150
from shiny.express import ui

with ui.sidebar(bg="#f8f8f8"):
    "Sidebar"

"Main content"
```

You can use navigation bars (navbars) to add different pages to your application.
Let's build on our current sidebar layout,
and add a navigation bar to the top of the application.
We can nest layouts by nesting the context managers.

:::{.callout-note}
Context managers are not specific to Shiny for Python.
They are features and tools used thought the Python ecosystem.
Typically you will not have to write your own context manager in Python
and use the `with` statement for an existing context manager.

For Shiny, all you need to remember that Shiny Express uses context managers
to layout each part of the user interface.
You can also nest shiny layout context managers,
but be mindful where the `with` statement is and where the indentations are.

## Page Layouts

If you need to embed different page layouts, you will need to look for the `ui.layout_*()` functions.

:::{.column-body-outset-right}
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 200
from shiny.express import ui

with ui.nav_panel("A"):
    with ui.layout_sidebar():
        with ui.sidebar(id="sidebar_left", open="desktop"):
            "Left sidebar content"
    "Main content"

with ui.nav_panel("B"):
    "Page 2 content"

with ui.nav_panel("C"):
    "Page C content"
```

## Restaurant Tips UI

For a given page, there are a few ways you can
[layout specific elements](layouts/panels-cards/#content-divided-by-cards).

Let's sketch out the basic outline of the shiny application.

![](../../assets/tipping-dashboard.png)

:::{.callout-note}
## Exercise

Let's replicate the restaurant tipping dashboard,
but only put in the UI elements.

The Restaurant Tipping dashboard has the following parts:

1. Title: "Restaurant tipping"
    - You can use the [`ui.page_opts()`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/express/express.ui.page_opts.html)
        and pass in a `title=''` parameter to add an application title.
1. Sidebar for a few input components (we'll add those later)
    - You can put some text here as a place holder, e.g., `"sidebar inputs"`
2. A full width column with 3 value boxes
    - Each value box will take up the same width of space
    - The value boxes will have labels for "Total tippers", "Average tip", and "Average bill"
    - The value boxes will need a placeholder value (we will populate them with a reactive value later)
3. A full width column with 2 cards, one for a dataframe and another for a scatter plot
    - Each card will share the same width of space
    - The care headers will have values of "Tips data" and "Total bill vs tip"
4. a full width column with 1 card
    - The card has a header of "Tip percentages"

## Solution

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 150
from shiny.express import input, ui

# title
ui.page_opts(title="Restaurant tipping", fillable=True)

# sidebar (empty for now)
with ui.sidebar(open="desktop"):
    "sidebar inputs"

# body of application

# first row of value boxes
with ui.layout_columns(fill=False):
    with ui.value_box():
        "Total tippers"
        42

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average tip"
        42

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average bill"
        42

# second row of cards
with ui.layout_columns(col_widths=[6, 6]):
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tips data")
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Total bill vs tip")

with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tip percentages")

```

## Context managers

You will typically not need to write your own context managers using the Python `with` statement.
If you would like to learn more about what context managers are,
and how to potentially write your own, you can check out
this
[context managers tutorial from Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/)

## Summary

We have now created a skeleton for our dashboard by laying out the main UI components.
We will now be able to add input components.
