So far we've seen how to customize our user interface,
and saw how we can use layouts, cards, and the 12-Grid CSS Bootstrap layout
to help place different elements on our web application.
Now let's get a sense of all the different kinds of input components we can work with.
You can see a list of all the possible input components in the
[components gallery](/components/).

In general, all the input components are imported with `from shiny.express import ui`,
and we can access each of the input components from the corresponding input
component function, `ui.input_*()`.
We typically pass in the input `id` as the first parameter,
and the `label` as the second parameter.
The `id` is a unique name for **each** input component that we can use
to look up its (reactive) value.
The `label` is the text that is displayed along with the input component,
it is usually the name or really short description for what the input component controls.
The rest of the arguments will differ for each component,
such as what values to be displayed for button choices,
or starting and ending range for a slider.
Each input component also has their own parameters for customizations specific for that particular input.

The [components gallery](/components/) is a great way to quickly see all the possible components
that come with Shiny for Python.
Each component page has their own mini example tutorial how to use the corresponding component.
It's useful to have the components page open to the side as you are
planning and building your application.

Let's combine a few of our layout knowledge from the previous lesson,
and add some input components to a shiny application.

Here we have a fillable page with 2 columns, each containing a card
with a different UI component in it.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
from shiny.express import ui

ui.page_opts(fillable=True)

with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card():
        ui.card_header("Card 1 header")
        ui.p("Card 1 body")
        ui.input_slider("slider", "Slider", 0, 10, 5)

    with ui.card():
        ui.card_header("Card 2 header")
        ui.p("Card 2 body")
        ui.input_text("text", "Add text", "")
```

## Exercise

Now that you have a bit more practice with UIs and Input components,
Let's build add a few inputs to our existing tips dashboard.

![](../../assets/tipping-dashboard.png)

Our application only has inputs in the left sidebar.
Let's add them to the application (we will work on connecting them with data later)

1. [`input_slider()`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/components/inputs/slider-range/):
    We'll use `0` and `100` as the lower and upper bounds for now.
    When we load our data we can calculate actual data range.
2. [`input_checkbox_group()`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/components/inputs/checkbox-group/):
    With a label of `Food service` and options for `Lunch` and `Dinner`.
3. [`input_action_button()`](https://shiny.posit.co/py/components/inputs/action-button/):
    Labeled `Reset filter`.

We will connect these inputs to outputs in the next lesson.

For reference, here's our current code and application:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 500
from shiny.express import input, ui

# title
ui.page_opts(title="Restaurant tipping", fillable=True)

# sidebar (empty for now)
with ui.sidebar(open="desktop"):
    "sidebar inputs"

# body of application

# first row of value boxes
with ui.layout_columns(fill=False):
    with ui.value_box():
        "Total tippers"
        "Value 1"

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average tip"
        "Value 2"

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average bill"
        "Value 3"

# second row of cards
with ui.layout_columns(col_widths=[6, 6]):
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tips data")
        "Tips DataFrame"

    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Total bill vs tip")
        "Scatterplot"

with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tip percentages")
        "ridgeplot"

```

## Solution

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 500
from shiny.express import input, ui

# title
ui.page_opts(title="Restaurant tipping", fillable=True)

# sidebar (empty for now)
with ui.sidebar(open="desktop"):
    ui.input_slider("slider", "Bill amount", min=0, max=100, value=[0, 100])
    ui.input_checkbox_group(
        "checkbox_group",
        "Food service",
        {
            "lunch": "Lunch",
            "dinner": "Dinner",
        },
    )
    ui.input_action_button("action_button", "Reset filter")


# body of application

# first row of value boxes
with ui.layout_columns(fill=False):
    with ui.value_box():
        "Total tippers"
        "Value 1"

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average tip"
        "Value 2"

    with ui.value_box():
        "Average bill"
        "Value 3"

# second row of cards
with ui.layout_columns(col_widths=[6, 6]):
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tips data")
        "Tips DataFrame"

    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Total bill vs tip")
        "Scatterplot"

with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card(full_screen=True):
        ui.card_header("Tip percentages")
        "ridgeplot"
