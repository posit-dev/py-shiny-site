title: Routing
---

This page covers how to access and extend a Shiny applications server,
including adding new routes.
Shiny is built on top of the web server framework [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/),
which allows a wide range of customization.

## Adding routes

Shiny apps can be put alongside each other, and other starlette applications.

Here is an example.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles

from shiny import App, ui

# first starlette app, just serves static files ----
app_static = StaticFiles(directory=".")

# shiny app ----
app_shiny = App(ui.page_fluid("hello from shiny!"), None)


# combine apps ----
routes = [
    Mount('/static', app=app_static),
    Mount('/shiny', app=app_shiny)
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

This application can be run using tools like `uvicorn`, as discussed in [deployment](deploy-on-prem.qmd).
