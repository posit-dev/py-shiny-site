With Shiny, you can create a wide variety of user interfaces (UI), including dashboards.
Here, we'll use the following dashboard as motivation to learn about some important UI components (e.g., [cards](#cards), [value boxes](#value-boxes)) and layouts (e.g., [columns](#multi-column-layout)).

## A quick start

Before we walk through a more sophisticated dashboard, consider this basic dashboard with a header (i.e., page title) and a sidebar layout. In the sidebar, there are a couple [inputs](/components/#inputs) for getting different views of the data, and in the main content area, is a [plotly output](jupyter-widgets.qmd). That output is also placed in a card to give it some depth and the ability to go full screen. The card isn't critical when there is only one output, but they come highly recommended when there are multiple outputs to display.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [viewer, editor]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 500
from shiny.express import input, render, ui
from shinywidgets import render_plotly

ui.page_opts(title="Penguins dashboard", fillable=True)

with ui.sidebar():
    ui.input_selectize(
        "var", "Select variable",
        ["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g", "year"]
    )
    ui.input_numeric("bins", "Number of bins", 30)

with ui.card(full_screen=True):
    @render_plotly
    def hist():
        import plotly.express as px
        from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
        return px.histogram(load_penguins(), x=input.var(), nbins=input.bins())
```

## Layout and components

Now let's work up to a more sophisticated dashboard by walking through layouts and components that are useful for dashboards step-by-step.

<!-- TODO: Callout layout and components galleries -->

### Sidebar layout

Create a sidebar layout by giving content to `ui.sidebar()`.
It's usually a good idea to place [inputs](/components/#inputs) in the sidebar and [outputs](/components/#outputs) in the main content area.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 200
from shiny.express import ui

ui.page_opts(title = "Title")

with ui.sidebar():
    "Sidebar (input)"

"Main content (output)"
```

::: callout-tip
#### Multi-page apps

To create a sidebar layout with multiple pages, just put each page's content in a top-level `ui.nav_panel()`, as shown [here](overview.qmd#layouts).
:::


### Cards {#cards}

Cards are great for visually grouping together related content, and it's best practice to place related components together in a card.
Here you'll also have an opportunity to add a header, footer, add `full_screen` capability, and more.
As we'll see later, cards are also useful for making outputs stand out from one another when there are multiple outputs to display.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
from shiny.express import render, ui

with ui.card(full_screen=True):
    ui.card_header("A card with a header")
    @render.plot
    def plot():
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        return plt.scatter([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

with ui.card():
    ui.markdown("Another card with some _markdown_.")
```


### Value boxes {#value-boxes}

Value boxes are great for highlighting important summaries.
They require at least two values (the title and value) and also support a `showcase` argument for adding a visual representation of the value.
The `showcase` argument can technically be any UI element, but is often a [faicons](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-faicons) (i.e., [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)) icon.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
from shiny.express import render, ui
from faicons import icon_svg as icon

with ui.value_box(showcase=icon("piggy-bank")):
    "Total sales"
    "$1,000,000"

with ui.value_box(showcase=icon("person")):
    "Total customers"
    @render.ui
    def customers():
        return f"{1000:,}"
```

::: callout-note

Under the hood, value boxes are built on cards, so you can leverage similar options like `full_screen`.
:::


### Multi-column layout {#multi-column-layout}

Create a multi-column layout based on a 12-column grid system by using `ui.layout_columns()`.
By default, an intelligent equal-width layout is created, but each column width can be specified (in units of 1/12) using `col_widths`:

::: column-body-outset-right

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 200
from shiny.express import ui

with ui.layout_columns(col_widths=[6, 6, 12]):
    with ui.card():
        "Card 1"
    with ui.card():
        "Card 2"
    with ui.card():
        "Card 3"
```

:::

::: callout-tip
#### Responsive layout

By default, `col_widths` doesn't apply on smaller width (i.e., mobile) screens (in that case, columns go full-width).
However, `col_widths` also accepts a dictionary of column widths for different screen sizes (e.g., `col_widths=dict(sm=6, md=4)` yields 2 columns on small screens and 3 columns on medium (or larger) screens).
:::


### Filling layout

Set `ui.page_opts(fillable=True)` to encourage content to fill the screen.
Many of Shiny's layouts and components automatically fill the screen when this option is set, which is often desirable for dashboards, but may not be what you want for things like value boxes or cards with a textual description. You can override the filling behavior on a per-component basis by setting `fill=False` or by specifying a `height`:

::: column-body-outset-right

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
from shiny.express import ui

ui.page_opts(fillable = True)

with ui.layout_column_wrap(fill=False):
    with ui.value_box():
        "Value box"
        "$1,000,000"

    with ui.value_box():
        "Value box"
        "$1,000,000"

with ui.card():
    "Card that fills remaining space..."
```

:::

::: callout-tip
#### Resizable viewer

Did you know the app viewer above is resizable? Try resizing it to see how the layout responds (the card fills the remaining space).
:::

### Tooltips and popovers

Tooltips and popovers are a useful means for both displaying and interacting with additional information in a non-obtrusive way.
Tooltips are shown on hover, whereas popovers are shown on click, making them more suitable for interactive content like inputs.
In the [actual dashboard](#all-together-now), we'll leverage a popover to effectively add a toolbar with additional inputs controls to card headers.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 100
from shiny.express import ui
from faicons import icon_svg as icon

"Hover this icon: "

with ui.tooltip():
    icon("circle-info")
    "Tooltip message"

ui.br()

"Click this icon: "

with ui.popover(title="Popover title"):
    icon("circle-info")
    "Popover message"
```


## Building a complete dashboard

Let's put it all together to create a dashboard for exploring restaurant tipping data.

Here we use a [sidebar](#sidebar-layout) to hold our "global" inputs, and place outputs in [cards](#cards). These cards are laid out [column-wise](#multi-column-layout), and [value boxes](#value-boxes) highlight the most important numbers. Finally, inputs that are specific to each are placed in a [popover](#tooltips-and-popovers) so that they are unobtrusive and don't distract the user from the main application content.
