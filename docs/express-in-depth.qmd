This article digs into some more advanced topics in Shiny Express.
It also highlights how some of these topics are less of a concern in Shiny Core.

## Holding

One way to avoid repeating yourself in Express is to use the `ui.hold()` context manager.

```python
with ui.hold() as hello_card:
    with ui.card():
        "Hello world!"

hello_card
hello_card
```

### Parameterized reuse

As we'll see later, `@expressify` allows facilitates reuse of Express code, but in a parameterized way.
:::

`ui.hold()` is also useful for decoupling UI and server logic.
To understand why decoupling is useful, let's first look at how Express normally couples UI and server logic.

## Decoupling {#decoupling}

In Express, things like render functions get displayed exactly where they appear in the code.
This is great for simple apps, but can lead to code that's harder to reason about as your application grows in size and complexity.
For example, consider this snippet of an Express app -- can you visualize, at a glance, how the overall UI is structured?

<details open>
  <summary style="margin-bottom: -1em;">Hide code</summary>
```{.python}
with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card():
        @render.plot
        def pair_plot():
            df = load_penguins()
            if df is None:
                print("Dataframe is empty")
                return

            # Drop rows with missing values
            df = df.dropna()

            # Get list of features
            features = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

            # Create a figure and axes with a subplot for each pair of features
            fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(features), len(features), figsize=(15, 15))

            # Create scatter plots for each pair of features
            for i in range(len(features)):
                for j in range(len(features)):
                    if i != j:
                        for species in df['species'].unique():
                            axs[i, j].scatter(df[df['species']==species][features[i]],
                                              df[df['species']==species][features[j]],
                                              label=species)
                        axs[i, j].set_xlabel(features[i])
                        axs[i, j].set_ylabel(features[j])
                    else:
                        axs[i, j].text(0.5, 0.5, features[i], ha='center', va='center')

            # Add a legend
            handles, labels = axs[0, 1].get_legend_handles_labels()
            fig.legend(handles, labels, loc='upper center')

            fig.tight_layout()
            return fig
        ui.input_select("species", "Species", ["Chinstrap", "Adelie", "Gentoo"])
```
</details>

The `render.plot` function above has a lot going on, and so it's easy to overlook that there's a `ui.input_select()` which appears just below the plot, inside the same card.

Express does offer a way to workaround this problem: the `ui.hold()` context manager, which allows you to define a `render` function in one place, then display it in another.
As a result, it's a lot more clear how the overall UI is structured:

```{.python}
with ui.hold():
    @render.plot
    def pair_plot():
        ... # code here


# Overall UI structure is now more clear
with ui.layout_columns():
    with ui.card():
        ui.output_plot("pair_plot")
        ui.input_select("species", "Species", ["Chinstrap", "Adelie", "Gentoo"])
```

### Decoupling in Shiny Core

Shiny Core enforces decoupling of UI and server in a similar way.
:::


## Implicit UI

In [decoupling](#decoupling), we first saw how decoupling server from UI logic requires a `ui.output_*()` container element connect the two.
Power users will find that having explicit control over these containers gives them more control over those component styling (since [UI is HTML](ui-html.qmd), HTML/CSS can be used to customise the component containers).

Express has one other important place where an implicit UI container is used: the overall page layout.
This is often convenient, since Express can infer a sensible layout based on the top-level UI components, but it can also be limiting to not have explicit control over the page layout.
Express does offer a `ui.page_opts()` to add a title and other page options, but it's not as flexible working directly with an explicit page container.


## Reusable abstractions {#expressify}

In [holding](#holding), we learned how `ui.hold()` helps to avoid repeating Express code verbatim.
This is great, but it doesn't allow for code parameterization, which is useful for creating reusable abstractions that manage complexity.
For example, suppose we want to create many cards that each contain a plot and a title.
Instead of repeating card logic over and over, we can wrap it in a function decorated with `@expressify`.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shiny.express import expressify, output, render, ui

@expressify
def custom_card(i):
    with ui.card():
        f"Card {i}"

        @output(id=f"hist_{i}")
        @render.plot(alt="A histogram", height=150)
        def _():
            np.random.seed(19680801)
            x = 100 + 15 * np.random.randn(437)
            plt.hist(x, 20, density=True)

for i in range(3):
    custom_card(i)
```

::: callout-note
### Shiny Core embraces reusable functions

Since Shiny Core embraces functional programming, creating reusable code is as simple as defining a function.
Reusable abstractions in Shiny Core are often simpler to understand since it's easier to see/remember just the inputs and output of a function, rather its implementation details.
:::


## Reactive Express code {#reactive-displays}

In Shiny, just `render` and `reactive` functions are reactive.
That is, other UI components like `ui.input_*()`, `ui.card()`, etc. are static: they don't change once the app is rendered.
In order to make those otherwise static components reactive in Express, you have to wrap them in a function decorated with `@render.express`.
This decorator is a bit of an exception to the rule compared to other `render` decorators since it's called for its side-effects, and not for its return value.

For example, suppose we want a checkbox to toggle whether to display even or odd numbers.
We can do this by wrapping the Express code in a function and decorating it with `@render.express`.
As a result, you can read reactive dependencies (e.g., `input.even()`), and function will be re-run whenever those dependencies change.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shiny.express import input, expressify, output, render, ui

@expressify
def custom_card(i):
    with ui.card():
        f"Card {i}"

        @output(id=f"hist_{i}")
        @render.plot(alt="A histogram", height=150)
        def _():
            np.random.seed(19680801)
            x = 100 + 15 * np.random.randn(437)
            plt.hist(x, 20, density=True)


@render.express
def cards():
    for i in range(input.n()):
        custom_card(i)
```



## Shared objects

For better performance, it's often useful to have some code run _once_ when the app initializes, not every time a new connection (i.e., session) is made.
Normal Express code is re-executed everytime a new connection is made, so it's not a good place to do expensive work that only needs to be done once.
Fortunately, if you move expensive code to a separate module, it will only be executed once (and objects can then be shared across sessions).

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 120

from shiny.express import render
import shared
# Runs once per session
@render.data_frame
def df():
    return shared.df

## file: shared.py
# Runs once per startup
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
df = pd.read_csv(Path(__file__).parent / "data.csv")
## file: data.csv
col1,col2
1,2
3,4
```


::: callout-note
In Shiny Core, code outside of the `server` function scope runs once per startup (not per user session).
See the code below for the equivalent Shiny Core app.

<details>
  <summary>Show code</summary>
```{.python}
from shiny import App, render, ui
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

df = pd.read_csv(Path(__file__).parent / "data.csv") # Read in once

app_ui = ui.page_fixed(ui.output_data_frame("dat"))

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.data_frame
    def dat():
        # Returned to each session
        return df

app = App(app_ui, server)
```
</details>
:::

::: callout-tip
### Shared reactive objects

It's also possible to share reactive objects across sessions.
This can be potentially dangerous since one users activity could impact another's, but also quite useful in combination [`reactive.file_reader`](../api/reactive.file_reader.qmd) and [`reactive.poll`](../api/reactive.poll.qmd) to create a reactive data source that's only polled once, no matter how many users are connected.
:::

## Sessions

Shiny apps have an object that represent a particular user's [session](../api/Session.html).
This object is useful for a variety of more advanced tasks like [sending messages to the client](../api/Session.html#shiny.Session.send_custom_message) and [serving up session-specific data](../api/Session.html#shiny.Session.dynamic_route).
In Express, you'll need to import `session` from `shiny.express` and only use it inside a reactive function, like a `@reactive.effect`:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 75
from shiny import reactive
from shiny.express import session, ui

@reactive.effect
async def _():
    x = {"message": "Hello from Python!"}
    await session.send_custom_message("send_alert", x)

ui.tags.script(
    """
    Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("send_alert", function(x) {
        document.body.innerHTML = x.message;
    });
    """
)
```

::: callout-note
### Shiny Core sessions

In Shiny Core, the session object is available through `server` function, and can be used anywhere in the server function scope.

## Functional programming {#functional}

Express promotes an imperative ([opposed to functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Comparison_to_imperative_programming)) programming style that is easier to get started with, but again, can make it difficult to manage complexity and reason about your app.
In particular, keeping track of UI state throughout the app can be difficult since imperative commands can change that state at any point in the code.
For example, consider this snippet of Express code -- understanding the state of the UI requires mentally parsing the code, and keeping track of the side-effects.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 50
import shiny.express

for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        f"Even: {i} "
```

That said, you can certainly write functional code in Express, which at least limits the amount of side-effects to keep track of, and also provides a means for storing UI state in an inspectable object.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 50
import shiny.express

x = [f"Even: {i} " for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0]
x
```

::: callout-note
### Shiny Core avoids side-effects

In a sense, Shiny Core _forces_ you to avoid using imperative code to define your UI, since you're expected to define your UI as a single, tree-like, object.
:::

### Reusable express code

Another problem that arises from building UIs via side-effects is that it's not always clear how create reusable side-effects (i.e., avoid repeating yourself).
Express does provide a solution for this: wrap your Express code in a function decorated with `@expressify`.
Just make sure to call this function for it's side-effects, and not for its return value.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 50
from shiny.express import expressify

@expressify
def evens(n = 5):
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            f"Even: {i} "

evens(3)
"--- "
evens(6)
```
