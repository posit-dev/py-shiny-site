## Generative AI quick start

Pick from one of the following providers below to get started with generative AI in your Shiny app.
Once you've choosen a provider, copy/paste the `shiny create` terminal command to get the relevant source files on your machine.

::: {.panel-tabset .panel-pills}

### LangChain with OpenAI

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/hello-providers/langchain
```

### OpenAI

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/hello-providers/openai
```

### Anthropic

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/hello-providers/anthropic
```

### Google

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/hello-providers/gemini
```

### Ollama

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/hello-providers/ollama
```

### OpenAI via Azure

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/enterprise/azure-openai
```

### Anthropic via AWS Bedrock

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/enterprise/aws-bedrock-anthropic
```

:::

Once the `app.py` file is on your machine, open it and follow the instructions at the top of the file.
These instructions should help with signing up for an account with the relevant provider, obtaining an API key, and finally get that key into your Shiny app.

Note that all these examples roughly follow the same pattern, with the only real difference being the provider-specific code for generating responses.
If we were to abstract away the provider-specific code, we're left with the pattern shown below.
Most of the time, providers will offer a `stream=True` option for generating responses, which is preferrable for more responsive and scalable chat interfaces.
Just make sure to use `.append_message_stream()` instead of `.append_message()` when using this option.

::: {.panel-tabset .panel-pills}

### Streaming

```python
from shiny.express import ui

chat = ui.Chat(id="my_chat")
chat.ui()

@chat.on_user_submit
async def _():
    messages = chat.messages()
    response = await my_model.generate_response(messages, stream=True)
    await chat.append_message_stream(response)
```

### Non-streaming

```python
from shiny.express import ui

chat = ui.Chat(id="my_chat")
chat.ui()

@chat.on_user_submit
async def _():
    messages = chat.messages()
    response = await my_model.generate_response(messages)
    await chat.append_message(response)
```
:::


::: callout-tip
### Appending is async

Appending messages to a chat is always an async operation.
This means that you should `await` the `.append_message()` or `.append_message_stream()` method when calling it and also make sure that the callback function is marked as `async`.
:::

The templates above are a great starting point for building a chat interface with generative AI.
And, out of the box, `Chat()` provides some nice things like [error handling](#error-handling) and [code highlighting](#code-highlighting).
However, to richer and bespoke experiences, you'll want to know more about things like message formats, startup messages, system messages, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and more.

## Message format

When calling `chat.messages()` to retrieve the current messages, you'll generally get a tuple of dictionaries following the format below.
This format also generally works when adding messages to the chat.

```python
message = {
  "content": "Message content",
  "role": "assistant" | "user" | "system", # choose one
}
```

Unfortunately, this format is not universal across providers, and so it may not be directly usable as an input to a generative AI model.
Fortunately, `chat.messages()` has a `format` argument to help with this.
That is, if you're using a provider like OpenAI, you can pass `format="openai"` to `chat.messages()` to get the proper format for generating responses with OpenAI.

Similarly, the return type of generative AI models can also be different.
Fortunately, `chat.append_message()` and `chat.append_message_stream()` "just work" with most providers, but if you're using a provider that isn't yet supported, you should be able to reshape the response object into the format above.

## Startup messages

To show message(s) when the chat interface is first loaded, you can pass a sequence of `messages` to `Chat`.
Note that, assistant messages are interpreted as markdown by default.[^html-responses]

[^html-responses]: The interpretation and display of assistant messages [can be customized](#custom-response-display).

```python
message = {
  "content": "**Hello!** How can I help you today?",
  "role": "assistant"
}
chat = ui.Chat(id="chat", messages=[message])
chat.ui()
```

![](/images/chat-hello.png)

In addition to providing instructions or a welcome message, you can also use this feature to provide system message(s).


## System messages

Different providers have different ways of working with system messages.
If you're using a provider like OpenAI, you can have message(s) with a `role` of `system`.
However, other providers (e.g., Anthropic) may want the system message to be provided in to the `.generate_response()` method.
To help standardize how system messages interact with `Chat`, we recommending to using [LangChain's chat models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/quick_start/).
This way, you can just pass system message(s) on startup (just like you would with a provider like OpenAI):

```python
system_message = {
  "content": "You are a helpful assistant",
  "role": "system"
}
chat = ui.Chat(id="chat", messages=[system_message])
```

Just make sure, when using LangChain, to use `format="langchain"` to get the proper format for generating responses with LangChain.

```python
@chat.on_user_submit
async def _():
    messages = chat.messages(format="langchain")
    response = await my_model.astream(messages)
    await chat.append_message_stream(response)
```

Remember that you can get a full working template in the [Generative AI quick start](#generative-ai-quick-start) section above.
Also, for another more advanced example of dynamic system messages, check out this example:

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/playground
```

## Message trimming

When the conservation gets becomes excessively long, it's often desirable to discard "old" messages to prevent errors and/or costly response generation.
To help with this, `chat.messages()` only keeps the most recent messages that fit within a conservative `token_limit`.
See [the documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/ui.Chat.html) for more information on how to adjust this limit. Note that trimming can be disabled by setting `.messages(token_limit=None)` or `Chat(tokenizer=None)`.


## Error handling {#error-handling}

When errors occur in the `@on_user_submit` callback, the app displays a dismissible notification about the error.
When running locally, the actual error message is shown, but in production, only a generic message is shown (i.e., the error is sanitized since it may contain sensitive information).
If you'd prefer to have errors stop the app, that can also be done through the `on_error` argument of `Chat` (see [the documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/ui.Chat.html) for more information).

![](/images/chat-error.png){class="rounded shadow"}

## Code highlighting {#code-highlight}

When a message response includes code, it'll be syntax highlighted (via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)) and also include a copy button.

![](/images/chat-code.png){class="rounded shadow"}

## Custom response display

By default, message strings are interpreted as (github-flavored) markdown.
To customize how assistant responses are interpreted and displayed, define a `@chat.transform_assistant_response` function that returns `ui.HTML`.
For a basic example, you could use `ui.markdown()` to customize the markdown rendering:

```python
chat = ui.Chat(id="chat")

@chat.transform_assistant_response
def _(content: str) -> ui.HTML:
    return ui.markdown(content)
```

::: callout-tip
### Streaming transformations

When streaming, the transform is called on each iteration of the stream, and gets passed the accumulated `content` of the message received thus far.
For more complex transformations, you might want access to each chunk and a signal of whether the stream is done.
See the [the documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/ui.Chat.html) for more information.
:::


::: callout-tip
### `chat.messages()` defaults to `transform_assistant=False`

By default, `chat.messages()` doesn't apply `transform_assistant_response` to the messages it returns.
This is because the messages are intended to be used as input to the generative AI model, and so should be in a format that the model expects, not in a format that the UI expects.
So, although you _can_ do `chat.messages(transform_assistant=True)`, what you might actually want to do is "post-process" the response from the model before appending it to the chat.
:::


## Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

RAG is a common and useful technique for "more advanced" generative AI.
Boiled down its core, this means taking user input, applying some kind of transformation to it, and then using that transformed value to generate a response.
A basic example might be to take the user input, prepend a "Translate this to French: " to it, and then use that as the input to a translation model (although, a system message might be more appropriate in this case, but you get the idea):


```python
chat = ui.Chat(id="chat")

@chat.transform_user_input
def _(input: str) -> str:
    return f"Translate this to French: {input}"
```


A more realistic example might be to allow the user to enter a URL to a website, and then pass the content of that website to the LLM along with [some instructions](#system-messages) on how to summarize or extract information from it.
For a concrete example, this template allows you to enter a URL to a website that contains a recipe, and then the assistant will extract the ingredients and instructions from that recipe in a structured format:

```bash
shiny create -g https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tree/main/examples/chat/RAG/recipes
```

![](/images/chat-code.png){class="rounded shadow"}

In addition to providing a helpful startup message, the app above also improves UX by gracefully handling errors that happen in the transform.
That is, when an error occurs, it appends a useful message to the chat and returns `None` from the transform.

```python
@chat.transform_user_input
async def try_scrape_page(input: str) -> str | None:
    try:
        return await scrape_page_with_url(input)
    except Exception:
        await chat.append_message(
            "I'm sorry, I couldn't extract content from that URL. Please try again. "
        )
        return None
```
