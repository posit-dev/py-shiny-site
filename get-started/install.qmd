Shiny for Python can be installed can be installed via `pip` or `conda`.

::: {.panel-tabset .panel-pills}

#### pip

Before installing you may want to upgrade `pip` and install `wheel`.
This will help with making your installations faster and less error-prone.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

Next, install `shiny` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install shiny
```

If you already have `shiny` installed, and you want to upgrade the `shiny` packages,
you will need to use the `--upgrade` flag.

```bash
pip install --upgrade shiny htmltools
```

##### Virtual environments

{{< include include/why-virtual-env.qmd >}}

Python already comes with a mechanism to create virtual environments with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Suppose you want to create a new Shiny app named `myapp`:

```bash
# Create and move into your shiny application directory
mkdir myapp
cd myapp

# Create a virtual environment in the .venv subdirectory
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Your prompt will change to have the .venv prefix

# Now install Shiny in your environment
pip install shiny
```

You are now ready to start building your app!
All packages you install (e.g., `shiny`, `pandas`, `plotly`, etc) will now stay inside `.venv`, scoped to just this project.
You can save a list of all the packages you want for this project in a `requirements.txt` file.

##### Development versions

If you want to install the development versions, you can do so with:


```bash
pip install https://github.com/posit-dev/py-htmltools/tarball/main
pip install https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/tarball/main
```
:::

#### conda

You can install `shiny` from the [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/) channel.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge shiny
```

If you already have `shiny` installed, and you want to upgrade the `shiny` package you will use the `conda update` command.

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge shiny
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
##### Conda Virtual environments

{{< include include/why-virtual-env.qmd >}}

You can also use `conda` to create virtual environments.

Unlike some other tools, you don’t need to be inside a specific folder when you create a `conda` environment.
Conda environments are managed separately and can be used from anywhere on your system once they are created.

```bash
# Create a conda environment named 'shiny' install the shiny package with latest python
conda create --name shiny -c conda-forge shiny python

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate shiny

# Your prompt will be pre-pended with shiny
```
:::

#### uv

You can install `shiny` using `uv pip`

```bash
uv pip install shiny
```

If you already have `shiny` installed, and you want to upgrade the `shiny` packages,
you will need to use the `--upgrade` flag.

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade shiny htmltools
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
##### Virtual environments

{{< include include/why-virtual-env.qmd >}}

You can also use `uv` to create virtual environments with `uv venv` to create a Python `.venv` directory.

```bash
# Create and move into your shiny application directory
mkdir myapp
cd myapp

# Create a virtual environment, defaults to .venv
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # on Windows (PowerShell)

# Your prompt will prepend with the current directory name

# Install into venv
uv pip install shiny
```

## Positron {#positron}

We recommend using
[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html),
a next-generation data science focused [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of Visual Studio Code.

Even if you already have VS Code installed, [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html) is worth trying out.
It installs separately, so your existing VS Code extensions won’t conflict with [Positron extensions](https://positron.posit.co/extensions.html).

Positron already ships with many Python-focused VS Code [extensions](https://positron.posit.co/extensions.html) from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/),
including [Quarto](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter), and [Pyright](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-pyright/pyright).

To get started with Shiny for Python, you will need to install the
[Shiny Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/posit/shiny).
This adds helpful features like a play ▶️ button in the top-right corner of the editor to run your Shiny app with one click.

## Visual Studio Code

For for [Visual Studio Code][vscode],
you will need the [Python][vscode-python] and [Shiny][vscode-shiny] extensions.

If [type checking is important to you](https://john-tucker.medium.com/type-checking-python-306ad8339da1), in addition to installing the [Python VSCode extension][vscode-python], you may want to do some additional configuration for a smooth experience with types in Shiny. See the tip below for more details.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
##### Type checking

We recommend the following settings in your project's `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```default
{
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
    "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides": {
        "reportUnusedFunction": "none"
    }
}
```

or alternatively, if your project keeps these settings in `pyrightconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "typeCheckingMode": "basic",
  "reportUnusedFunction":  "none",
}
```

The `basic` type checking mode will flag many potential problems in your code, but it does require an understanding of type hints in Python. This is the mode that is used by the [Shinylive](https://shinylive.io) examples editor. If you want to make even greater use of type checking, you can use `strict` mode:

```json
   "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict"
```

In the above configuration, we also disable the `reportUnusedFunction` diagnostic, as it's idiomatic Shiny to create named functions that are never explicitly called by any code (i.e., `@reactive.effect`).

You can also modify these settings on a per-file basis with comments at the top of the file. For example, you might have something like this at the top of your `app.py`:

```python
# pyright: strict
# pyright: reportUnusedFunction=false
```

A full list of configuration settings for Pyright/Pylance is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).
