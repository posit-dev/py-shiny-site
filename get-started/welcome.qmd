```python
# | standalone: true

from shiny.express import ui, render, input
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

ui.input_slider("bins", "Number of Bins", min=5, max=20, value=15, step=1)


@render.plot
def plot():
    ax = sns.histplot(data=df, x="body_mass_g", bins=input.bins())

## Why Shiny

- **No JavaScript required** – Build full-featured interactive apps in pure Python.
  [Install](install.qmd) and [create your first app](create-run.qmd) now!
- **Fast and robust iteration** – The reactive model allows efficient and dynamic updates.
  [Learn more about reactivity](/docs/reactive-foundations.qmd).
- **Batteries Included** – Comes with everything you need for your applications and dashboards.
  Check out the [input](/components/#inputs) and [output](/components/#outputs) you can use in the [components gallery](/components/) and the different ways you can arrange elements with [layouts](/layouts/).
- **Scalability and extensibility** – Start simple, grow as needed. [Learn more about custom components](/docs/custom-component-one-off.qmd).
- **Starter templates** - Get up and running quickly with a [starter template](/templates/).
- **Open source** - Inspect, adapt, contribute, or join the [forum](https://forum.posit.co/c/shiny) or [discord](https://discord.com/invite/yMGCamUMnS) community! You can check out the [code](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/) or make your own [extensions](/docs/custom-component-one-off.qmd).

Shiny for Python empowers you to bring your data to life with interactive applications that are easy to [build](create-run.qmd), [customize](/docs/ui-customize.qmd), and [share](deploy.qmd).

The next pages in the [get started](what_is_shiny.qmd) will help you [install shiny](install.qmd),
[create and run](create-run.qmd) your first application,
provide you some [troubleshooting help](debug.qmd), and
[deploy](deploy.qmd) your application to the web (for [free](deploy-cloud.qmd)!)
