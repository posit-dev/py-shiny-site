When building Shiny applications, especially in a production environment, it is best practice to use a virtual environment.

Why use a virtual environment?

- Keeps your application's dependencies isolated from other global Python packages.
- Makes your application easier to [deploy and share](deploy.qmd).
- Helps avoid version conflicts between different projects.
