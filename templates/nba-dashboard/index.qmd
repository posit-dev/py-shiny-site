Search for NBA players and compare their career statistics.
The app uses the `nba_api` package to fetch player statistics and the `plotly` package to create interactive plots.
Note that in addition to searching for players by name, you can also click on the rug plot to select players.
This provides a useful way to query player(s) based on a specific statistic, then compare their overall career statistics.
