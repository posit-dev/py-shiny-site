A fun and useful way to explore different "real-life" scenarios you might encounter at work as someone who works with data.
Based on some information about your role, industry, and size of the business, the app will propose a series of scenarios and ask you to make a decision at each step.
The goal is to help you think through the implications of your decisions and how they might impact the business.
Towards the end, the app will provide for you some Python (or R) code snippets that you can use to create a reproducible end deliverable based on your decisions.
