        "We've been using the term \"reactive\" a lot during these tutorials.\n",
        "But what does it mean?\n",
        "It's actually more than \"user interacts with input and new value gets calculated\".\n",
        "Reactivity is actually what makes Shiny special:\n",
        "when an input changes, only the minimum amount of calculations are made to update the outputs.\n",
        "This makes shiny very efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shiny knows to re-execute **reactive functions** (e.g., `render` functions) when their **reactive dependencies** (e.g., `input`) change.\n",
        "There are other main forms of reactive functions and dependencies:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Calculations with `@reactive.calc`\n",
        "  * Write your reactive calculation once, then call it as needed.\n",
        "* Side effects with `@reactive.effect`\n",
        "  * Effects are similar to `@render.*` functions, but they don't return anything. They're used for their side-effects (e.g., writing to a database, sending an email, etc.)\n",
        "* Reactive values with `reactive.value`\n",
        "  * Create `input`-like values that aren't tied to input controls and can be updated. They're often used to maintain state in an app.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson we'll focus on the `@reactive.calc`, let's see why we may want reactive calculations.\n",
