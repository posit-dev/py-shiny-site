## Templates

This dashboard is one of many example dashboards available on the
[Shiny for Python Templates Page](https://shiny.posit.co/py/templates/).

If you want to download and run this application,
you can visit the
[Restaurant tips dashboard template page](https://shiny.posit.co/py/templates/dashboard-tips/)
and follow the command to downlaod the application

```bash
shiny create --template dashboard-tips --mode express --github posit-dev/py-shiny-templates
```

This will create a `dashboard-tips` folder in your current directory.
The output of the command will then prompt you to install the dependencies for the application
using `pip`.

```bash
$ shiny create --template dashboard-tips --mode express --github posit-dev/py-shiny-templates
ℹ Using GitHub repository posit-dev/py-shiny-templates.
… Creating Restaurant tips dashboard Shiny app...

→ Next steps:
- Install required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open and edit the app file: dashboard-tips/app.py
```

To run the example tips dashboard,
you can use the same `shiny run` command we did in the previous exercise.
The application code is in the `app.py` file.

```bash
shiny run
```

There are a few other files and modules that are in this example application.
We will spend the next few lessons of this tutorial going though each of the components.
