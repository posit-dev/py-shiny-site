title: Publish and Share Your Application

## `app.py`

At the start of these tutorials,
we've shown how to create an `app.py` file and how to run it
from either Positron, VS Code, or in the command line.

If your file begins with the `app` prefix,
the shiny extension for VS Code will give you a play button to run
the current file as a shiny application.

The play button executes the `shiny run` command in the terminal
for you, but you can manually run an application file
on your own.

```bash
shiny run app.py
```
This `app.py` file can be shared with others

## Shiny Live

Throughout these tutorials,
we provided you the code and working example in line with the text.
These applications were run using Shinylive.
It uses Shiny and WebAssembly to run Shiny applications
completely in the browser without having to set anything up.

If you have all your code in an `app.py` file,
you can go to the shiny live editor and paste in your code.
The shiny live editor is at this location: <https://shinylive.io/py/examples/>

:::{.callout-note}
There is no empty editor, the site will take you to the shinylive page and
default to one of the example applications.
You can copy and paste your `app.py` file into the editor and run it in the browser
:::

You cannot save the application file in the browser,
instead you can click on the "Share" button on the corner of the Shinylive page,
and use this URL to share your application with others.
There is an option to use the link that shows the code and rendered application.

:::{.callout-note}
Shinylive URLs are extremely long. That is because
all the code is embeded into the URL.

## Connect Cloud

[Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) is a free service that
allows you to publish your web applications.
You can actually use it to publish more than a shiny for python application!

The code you want published needs to first exist in a
[GitHub](https://github.com/)
repository.
Once your code is in a github repository,
you can use the Posit Connect Cloud interface to link to the repository,
and the service will automatically look for your `app.py` file to publish.
You can follow these instructions from the connect cloud shiny for python
publishing page:
<https://docs.posit.co/connect-cloud/how-to/python/shiny-python.html#deploy-to-posit-connect-cloud>

If you want to update your application,
you will make your changes, commit, and push them to the same github repository.
Connect Cloud has a
[republish](https://docs.posit.co/connect-cloud/user/manage/content_page.html#republish)
feature on the main page that will re-deploy your application.
